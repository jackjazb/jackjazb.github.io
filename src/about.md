I'm a UK based full stack developer with a focus on web technology and cloud native development. At home in a modern web stack, I have professional experience in TypeScript, React and Java; I'm also experienced with AWS, including Lambda, ECS, CloudFormation and a variety of others. I'm friendly, outgoing and a fast learner, and I'm always excited to learn and apply new technologies to my work. I'm current working at [Kore Labs](https://korelabs.co/).

I have a first class BSc. in Computer Science from the University of Birmingham, and developed a scalable meal planning solution using Rust and Elastic Container Service for my dissertation. In my spare time I'm a self taught musician and music producer. I've recorded several albums and have produced and released for other groups too.
